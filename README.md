# Computational Graphics Project

## In this project we aim to demonstrate a simple yet powerful 3D graphics tool as WebGL is.

## The main focus is to perform the animation of an object, its natural movement and the shading effects that light has on it and the surrounding environment.


### Main idea:
An animated cube that is able to randomly rotate in its own axis. The user is able to interact with thecamara by moving the position and also transforming the figures into its skeleton. As the cube rotates, the light reflects on different angles and produces a changing shade pattern which is reflected in the background/environment.
