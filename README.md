# Computational Graphics Project

## In this project we aim to demonstrate a simple yet powerful 3D graphics tool as WebGL is through the use of Three.js.

## The main focus is to perform the animation of an object, its natural movement and the shading effects that light has on it and the surrounding environment.


### Main idea:
An animated cube that is able to randomly rotate in its own axis. The user is able to interact with the camara by moving the position and also transforming the figures into its skeleton mesh. As the cube rotates, the light reflects on different angles and produces a changing shade pattern which is reflected in the background/environment.

## What is demonstrated:
- Different creation of simple 3D objects like cubes and spheres
- Animation of these objects through random rotations
- Lightning and shadow effects on the objects and on the plane
- The meshes that conform the 3D objects
- User interaction with the environment through mouse and keys movement
- Objects and view traslation.
