# Computational Graphics Project

## In this project we aim to demonstrate a simple yet powerful 3D graphics tool as WebGL is.

## The main focus is to perform the animation of an object, its natural movement and the shading effects that light has on it and the surrounding environment.


### Main idea:
An animated cube that is able to randomly rotate in its own axis. The user is able to interact with the cube's rotation via mouse/finger dragging. As the cube rotates, the light reflects on different angles and produces a changing shade pattern which is reflected in the background/environment.
